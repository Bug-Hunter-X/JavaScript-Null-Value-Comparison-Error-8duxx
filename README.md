# JavaScript Null Value Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to handling null values. The `bug.js` file shows an example of loose null comparison leading to unexpected behavior, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

The issue is highlighted in the `myFunction` function.  Improper null checks can lead to incorrect calculations or unexpected outputs.

This example emphasizes the importance of using strict equality (`===`) when comparing values in JavaScript, especially when dealing with `null` or `undefined`.
